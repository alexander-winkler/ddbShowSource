# ddbShowSource

This is a Firefox extension that adds a button to a DDB item page that links to the metadata source code.

The `*.xpi` file of this addon is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexander-winkler/ddbshowsource/main/xpi/f02131b55ede4cf0aedc-1.1.xpi).

Just click the URL and Firefox hopefully handles the rest. To find out more about your addons in Firefox, type `about:addons` into your URL bar.
